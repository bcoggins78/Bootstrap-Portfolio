                <p>Hi, my name is Bryant Coggins. I have worked at CompuCom Systems for 14 years through a
                    contract with a local financial institution. During my tenure I have worked as a field tech
                    and currently as a remote support tech. While this has been a good learning experience, I am
                    looking forward to refocusing my career to the world of coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Stanly Community College with an AAS degree in Computer Engineering
                    Technology. While in school I obtained my A+ and Network+ Certifications. I was also
                    introduced to HTML, Javascript, and C++. These classes peaked my interest in coding.
                </p>
                <p>In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with my wife and two dogs or playing the guitar. I
                    actually taught myself a few songs by playing Rocksmith on the computer. I am also an avid
                    gamer who appreciates a good RPG. Being a gamer I have built myself a few gaming rigs over
                    the years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After hearing about the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp from a past graduate, I knew this
                    would be a great opportunity to broaden my horizons. I am looking forward to what the future
                    holds!
                </p>
